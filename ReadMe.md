# Decentralized Identity System

A blockchain-based system for managing self-sovereign digital identities, credential issuance, verification, and reputation management.

## Overview

This decentralized identity system enables users to maintain control over their personal data while interacting with various services and building verifiable reputations. The system consists of four main smart contracts that work together to provide a comprehensive identity management solution.

## Core Components

### Identity Contract

The foundation of the system that manages self-sovereign identities:
- Creates and manages decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- Stores identity attestations and claims
- Enables users to control their identity data
- Supports identity recovery mechanisms
- Implements proper access control and privacy measures

### Credential Issuance Contract

Handles the creation and management of verifiable credentials:
- Issues standardized credentials to verified identities
- Maintains credential schemas and templates
- Supports credential revocation
- Implements expiration mechanisms
- Records credential metadata on-chain while storing sensitive data off-chain

### Verification Contract

Enables zero-knowledge credential verification:
- Validates credentials without exposing underlying data
- Implements zero-knowledge proof verification
- Maintains revocation lists
- Provides selective disclosure capabilities
- Supports credential-based access control

### Reputation Contract

Builds and manages reputation scores based on system interactions:
- Aggregates verified interactions and credentials
- Calculates weighted reputation scores
- Implements reputation transfer mechanisms
- Prevents reputation gaming
- Supports contextual reputation calculations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat/Truffle)
- Node.js 16+
- Solidity ^0.8.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentralized-identity-system.git
cd decentralized-identity-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deployment

1. Configure your network settings in `hardhat.config.js`
2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Usage

### Creating an Identity

```solidity
// Create a new identity
function createIdentity(address owner, bytes32 salt) external returns (bytes32 did);

// Add an attestation to an identity
function addAttestation(bytes32 did, bytes32 attestationType, bytes memory data) external;
```

### Issuing Credentials

```solidity
// Issue a new credential
function issueCredential(
    bytes32 did,
    bytes32 credentialType,
    bytes memory credentialData
) external returns (bytes32 credentialId);
```

### Verifying Credentials

```solidity
// Verify a credential
function verifyCredential(
    bytes32 credentialId,
    bytes memory proof
) external view returns (bool);
```

### Managing Reputation

```solidity
// Update reputation based on verified interaction
function updateReputation(
    bytes32 did,
    bytes32 contextId,
    uint256 score
) external;
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data should be stored off-chain
- Implement proper access control mechanisms
- Use secure random number generation for salt values
- Regular security audits are recommended
- Monitor for potential reputation gaming attempts
- Implement rate limiting for credential issuance
- Use secure zero-knowledge proof libraries
